      <h1>WebCrypto + IndexedDB</h1>
      <p>
        Securely create and persist public/private keys in the browser. In this
        demo, we use a key pair generated with WebCrypto to sign and validate a
        JWT completely in the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cool thing about using the CryptoKey interface of WebCrypto is that
        although we can use the key pair to sign and verify, the private key
        remains opaque to the end-user and the JS runtime. The private key
        itself is not extractable. We can store the CryptoKey object in
        IndexedDB for later retrieval and use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the private key is persisted, we can do things like continuously
        sign JWT's with the same private key (until browser storage is cleared).
        This can be handy for some use cases like

          >OAuth2's Dynamic Client Registration Protocol</a
        >.

      <p>
        In this demo, you should see a JWT being signed and validated using
        public/private keys signed with WebCrypto as you click on the buttons
        below. Note you need to have SSL enabled for this demo work - WebCrypto
        is disabled in non SSL environments.
