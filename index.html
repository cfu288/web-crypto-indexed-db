    <p>
      Securely create and persist public/private keys in the browser. In this
      example, we use a generated key pair to sign and validate a JWT completely
      in the browser. The key pair is never directly exposed to the end user or
      the JS runtime. The key itself is not extractable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the private key is persisted, we can continue to sign JWT's with
      the same private key until browser storage is cleared. This can be handy
      for some use cases like
      <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591"
        >OAuth2's Dynamic Client Registration Protocol</a
      >.

      <b>Open the console to see the demo (Press F12)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If everything is working, you should see a JWT being signed and validated
      in the console. Note you need to have SSL enabled for this to work.
